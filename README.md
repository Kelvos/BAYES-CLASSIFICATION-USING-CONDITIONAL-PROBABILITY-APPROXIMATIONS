# BAYES-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONDITIONAL-PROBABILITY-APPROXIMATIONS

Data prep

1/ Upload data as .csv


2/ .csv files should not contain column names or row numbers


3/ Data should be arranged X|Y. We assume the rightmost column is the target variable.


i.e. feature columns (X) are listed in the .csv from left to right and the target column Y is to the right of this. 




Insert the following information before running

1/ LOCATION ='Location_of_datasets' row 461 


2/ FILE = 'file_name' row 462 


3/ final_features = "string_list_of_features' eg. ['0','1','5'] row 469


4/ kappa = INT row 471
